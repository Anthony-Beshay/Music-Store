# Music-Store
In this project, I queried the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, I assisted the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.
The repository conatins 2 folders; project_1 and query_csv.
In project_1 folder there are 2 files; project_1_presentation and project_1_query.
Project_1_presentation is a 4-slides pdf investigating 4 questions using SQL, the presentation contains a plot answering each question and a brief explanation for the finding.
project_1_query is the queries used to answer the previously asked questions.
query_csv folder contains 4 csv files were used to create the plots in the presentation.
